Assumptions
- I assumed the search suggestions were supposed to have an hover effect so as to let the user know which suggestion they're currently hovering on, so I added that

Requirements
- All ui requirements were covered

Challenges Faced
- I spent quite a while working on limiting the books based on screen sizes, and it was exciting when I finally got the fix.
- The search suggestions functionality also took a bit of time.


Constructive Feedback
- The challenge was great, and fun. It's a great hands on development and a great way to test basic fundamentals of Javascript and DOM manipulations.
